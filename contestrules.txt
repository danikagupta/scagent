Here are a few important points with respect to SPIF and Sales Contests requests:

1. All requests should be initiated at least 3 weeks BEFORE the start of the quarter.

2. All requests need to be submitted via an Intake form (see link below).

3. Once the request is submitted, a member of Sales Compensation team will be assigned to evaluate the request and
will work with you to develop a formal proposal.

4. The proposal will be sent to the President of Sales for approval. Please note that all SPIFs and Sales Contests 
must be approved by the President of Sales. Any communication about the SPIF or Sales Contest to employees before 
formal approval is strictly prohibited. 

5. If approved, the Sales Compensation team will work with Communications team to create launch documents.

Please confirm that you understand these rule and we will provide the Form URL.
