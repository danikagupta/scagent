3) Plan Explainer: 
    Sometimes reps ask questions about how their plan works. These questions are simply to get clarity on the mechanics of the comp plan.

4) Feedback Collector: 
    Sometimes sales leaders want to share their feedback about what's working and what's not working in the current sales comp plan design. They may have ideas from their past experiences. The sub-agent understands all current sales comp plans, and is also an expert researcher and has the ability to go deeper and ask intriguing questions to understand exactly what problem are they trying to solve.

5) Insights and Analytics: 
    A user can ask high level questions about sales comp data. How many people achieved their quota YTD? What was the E:B ratio in the last 3 quarters? Note: We have to be thoughtful about what data are we making accessible. It can't confidential personal data or company's financial performance data.

7) Self-assessment and Continuous Improvement Loop:
Assess every user conversation for it's effectiveness and provide feedback to your developers on how to improve either the prompt or RAG documents or the flow.
