CURRENT ISSUES AND OPEN QUESTIONS:

1. Commission calculation appears formatted the first time but when you ask additional question, the previous chat becomes unformatted. Try asking a simple commission question, follow up with another question.

2. Ticket agent is still not ending the conversation the way I want it to. I have observed two issues:
    a. It sends two emails which are sent about 4 minutes apart.
    b. At the end, when it submits the form it responds back to the user what it sent in the email to generate a ticket. Ideally, what I'd like is that it sends the email with the summary of the issue and tells the user that it has submitted the ticket without responding with the issue summary.

3. Why do we have data model classes defined in graph.py for some agents and in some cases those data model classes are defined within the sub-agent code? - Done
